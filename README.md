# Ticket-viewer
Welcome to my iPhone version of Zendesck Ticket Viewer application.
Zendesk is a customer service tool that allows the creation and management of support tickets.

## The iOS app:
* Connects to Zendesk ticket API
* Requests the tickets for specific Zendesk account, pages through tickets when more than 25 are
returned
* Displays tickets in a list
* Displays individual ticket details
* Displays a friendly error message if the API is unavailable or the response is invalid
* Tells the user something is wrong if there is a program error


###### Xcode Version 10.2.1 and Swift 5 are used.
###### Tested on iPhone XR simulator.
